  <h3 style="color:Orange;">About:</h3>
<p style="color:Orange;">This here is Juan. I want to show you his hiring profile </p>

<p style="color:Orange;">Two good things about this man is his confidents and loyaltiy. This man, when I interviewed him, radiated radiated confidence. He tells me that he wakes up and sees what life would throw at him. And as the interview went on, he kept bringing up his friends and family. I saw how with others, he enjoyed their company and how well they get along with eachother. He mentioned his family alot and told me that he enjoy's spending his time with his mother and that he cannot live without his family.</p>

<p style="color:Orange;">One part of the interview that I find intreiging is when I asked him what character he would be for a day and why, and he told me superman because 1)its superman and 2)to  see how he goes through day to day knowing that he has such great power. And the second part, to me, is interesting because it shows how considerite he is by wanting to know how clart kent lives his days.</p>

 <p style="color:greenyellow;">During the interview, Juan told me that working out makes him happy. And with what I said about his confidence, he could potentially make a good coach. Motivating others into pushing themselves further and to not get off their grind.</p>

<p style="color:lightblue;">This man likes the supra5 and the dodge 1970's car modles. So that shows his intrest in auto mechanics, I think it could be cool if he was allowed to test drive them or at the very least be able to be a spoakes person for the cars.</p>

<p style="color:Yellow;">If not that he did show intrest in becoming a electircion, and if given the proper training, I'm sure he'll do great with the customers and have loads of positive reviews.</p>

<p style="color:Gold;">And on a final note, the dude is funny, he made me laugh I don't know how many times, and that could help boost the moral of others. </p>
